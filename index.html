        <em>A photo gallery that scrolls horizontally as a reader scrolls vertically that weighs 6.7kb with dependencies</em>

        <p>A <code>&lt;scrolly-photos&gt;</code> custom element that wraps any number of <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements and converts them into a horizontal scrolling gallery that is tied to the user's scroll position. Falls back to vertically stacking
            the images when Javascript is not available.</p>

        <p>This element uses <a href="https://pudding.cool/process/introducing-scrollama/"><code>scrollama</code></a> by Russell Samora to handle scroll management.</p>

        <p>Here's an example. The code below creates the horizontally scrolling set of photos beneath.</p>

        <p>PS: Remember to always include <code>alt</code> text with images.</p>
